# Chess simulator

Second learning of Python & Robot Framework.

The purpose of this program is to render a standard chessboard, run multiple simulations via random selection of pieces, turn by turn, and record the outcome.

Robot framework: https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework
and highly suggested pycharm from JetBRains https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ as the IDE.

For a faster start point, you may grab the install.sh from the repository.
 
Ensure that you are either on a Mac or Linux system else powershell on windows & you can run the install.sh which should grab and install everything that you need to get started.

You can type 

bash install.sh

and let the shell script do the heavy lifting.
